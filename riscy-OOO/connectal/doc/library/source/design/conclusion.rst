Conclusion
==========

`Connectal`_ bridges the gap between software and hardware development,
enabling developers to create integrated solutions rapidly. With
Connectal, we take a pragmatic approach to software and hardware
development in which we try to avoid any dependence on proposed
solutions to open research problems.

Use of Connectal's interface compiler ensures that software and
hardware remain consistent and make it easy to update the
hardware/software boundary as needed in a variety of execution
contexts. The generated portals permit concurrent and low-latency
access to the accelerator and enable different processes or the kernel
to have safe isolated access through dedicated interfaces.  Support
for sharing memory between software and hardware makes it easy to
achieve high transfer speeds between the two environments.

Connectal supports Linux and Android operating systems running on x86
and ARM CPUs. It currently supports Xilinx FPGAs and runs on the full
range of Xilinx Series 7 devices. Our fully-scripted development
process enables the use of continuous integration of software and
hardware development. Integrating software development early makes it
easier to ensure that the complete solution actually meets design
targets and customer requirements.
