For ALU (in fact CSRXXX) inst, rVal1 is CSR instead of rs1, and rVal2 may be
rs1.

FMA (3-source) insts are not implemented (decoded as illegal inst).

htifStall should be set precisely before any inst pass the stalling stage. A
better way is to change CSRF to return if mtohost is written.

When external world try to change a CSR, this change should be done when no
inst is in-flight, because an inst may do read-modify-write on the CSR, and
read and write are performed separately in different pipeline stages.

Dynamic rounding mode are not substitute with frm CSR at decode time. Need to
do this before sending to FPU. (It is done at checking for exception time, but
not recorded.)
