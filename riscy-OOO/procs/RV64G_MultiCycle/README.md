**This folder is no longer mainained.**

This folder contains a multi-cycle processor which was used for bumping the RISC-V privilege ISA from version 1.7 to 1.10.
After bumming the version, our development focused on the OOO core, and this one is not maintained any more.
Therefore, the code in this folder may not even compile.
